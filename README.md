## ✨ About

**PreTTY** is a modern terminal emulator that blends **simplicity** with **aesthetic design**.  
It’s built to be **portable**, **reliable**, and **ergonomic**, while staying true to the Unix spirit of `tty`.  

Think of it as a terminal that’s not just functional — but **pretty**. 🌸

---

## 🌱 Origin

The **PreTTY** project was initiated by [Gurjaka](https://github.com/Gurjaka) and [Sigmanificient](https://github.com/sigmanificient),  
driven by a shared interest in understanding how terminal emulators — tools we both use daily — work at a low level.  

Beyond being a practical utility, the project is also a learning endeavor:  
a way to apply and deepen our knowledge of **C programming** through building something real and complex.  

From the beginning, the vision has been clear:  
to create a **lightweight, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator** that incorporates modern features such as:  

- 🖼️ **Image rendering**  
- 🔤 **Ligatures**  
- ⚡ **Efficient performance and portability**  

PreTTY represents both an exploration into systems programming and a contribution to the open-source ecosystem.
